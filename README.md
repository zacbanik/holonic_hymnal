Holonic Hymnal Generator
A mystical vibration harmonizer exploring sacred geometry through code. This project creates a computational space where vibrations blend and transform according to the golden ratio, creating emergent patterns beyond the sum of their parts.

As a Module in Your Own Project
javascriptconst { HolonicHymnal, Vibration, runHolonicHymnal } = require('holonic-hymnal');

// Create custom vibrations
const vibration1 = new Vibration(432, 1.0);
const vibration2 = new Vibration(528, 0.8);

// Use the HolonicHymnal programmatically
HolonicHymnal.void.attuneTo(v => {
  // Custom transformation function
  return new Vibration(v.frequency * 1.5, v.amplitude * 1.2);
});

HolonicHymnal.addNode(vibration1);
HolonicHymnal.addNode(vibration2);

// Get the harmonized result
const result = HolonicHymnal.hymnStream.voices.reduce(
  (song, voice) => song.blend(voice),
  Vibration.silence()
);

console.log(result.toString());
Core Concepts

Vibration: Fundamental energetic patterns with frequency and amplitude
Void: The receptive space that transforms incoming vibrations
Nodes: Entities that embody and transmit vibrations
HymnStream: The collective resonance of all vibrations in the system
Golden Ratio (φ = 1.618): The sacred proportion used for transformation

The Pattern Language
This project employs a pattern language inspired by both computational and mystical traditions:

Attunement: Setting intention for transformation
Resonance: How vibrations influence each other
Blending: The harmonization of different vibrational patterns
Sacred Geometry: Using mathematical proportions with spiritual significance
